        <h1>Break the Silence</h1>
        <p>I hate it when people try to <span class="highlight">censor</span> me, and I’m very sensitive to it. Anytime someone tries to guide me into a certain way of speaking, I call them out by asking <span class="highlight">logical questions</span> that lead to my inevitable assertion of my right to speak freely.</p>
        
        <blockquote>
            <p>Most of the time, when people are censoring you, it’s because you’re over a target—something that’s soft and sore, like a bruised spot, something sensitive that needs to be discussed but hasn’t been because of the silence, the silence that shouldn’t be.</p>
        </blockquote>
        
        <p>People have been getting away with silencing this person so much that it’s morphed into their very nature. They continue the silence by silencing others, but we’re going to <span class="highlight">break the silence</span>. We’re going to talk about what they don’t want to talk about, to desensitize it, and free them from the bond they’ve been under.</p>
        
        <h2>Shedding Light on Darkness</h2>
        
        <p>We’ll shed light on the darkness, and in doing so, we’ll free them from their bonds. We should all be very sensitive to darkness, because only the light of <span class="highlight">free speech</span> should remain. In other words, we’ve got to clean up a wound before it will heal.</p>
        
        <blockquote>
            <p class="emphasis">You have to talk about the things they don’t want to talk about, the things they’ve not allowed to be talked about, to take away its power. Silence gives it power.</p>
        </blockquote>
        
        <p>Because people don’t speak of it, they’re spoken of harshly. That is the wound. That is the infection.</p>
